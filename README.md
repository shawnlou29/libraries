## Introduction

### Overview  
The **Library API** is a robust and efficient solution designed to streamline library administration tasks. Built with the Slim Framework, it offers developers and system integrators a lightweight yet powerful tool for rapid web application and API development.

### Key Features  

- **Token Storage**  
  The API requires tokens for secure interactions. It is recommended to store tokens in secure and encrypted storage mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and ensure user data protection.  

- **User Verification**  
  To ensure data security and proper usage, the API validates the identity of users before granting access to resources.  

- **Development Tools**  
  The API is developed using the **Slim Framework**, a lightweight PHP micro-framework known for its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful routing capabilities. This choice allows for rapid development, easy integration of third-party libraries, and efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.
